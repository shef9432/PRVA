## 🚩 About
In industrial deployment, AI model performance is often fragile against physical environmental fluctuations. **PRVA (Physical-reality Validation & Assessment)** is an open validation and evaluation method / framework designed to quantify the performance boundaries of vision models under varying physical stresses.

**The Core Philosophy:**
PRVA is an **open method for validating and assessing industrial AI reliability**. We believe that in mission-critical manufacturing, the training process is only the beginning—the **Reliability Loop** is what truly defines production readiness.

## 🏗️ Core Modules
- **PhysCorruptor:** A simulation engine that injects controlled physical variables (Lux, DPI, Motion Blur, Defocus, ISO Noise) into raw samples to stress-test model robustness.
- **Audit Logger:** Outputs standardized performance metrics (CSV/JSON) for deep-dive production auditing.
- **Inference Bridge:** A model-agnostic interface supporting third-party architectures (e.g., YOLO, ResNet) via standard protocols without modifying core model code.
- **Analysis Tool:** Visualization utilities for mapping the **Safe Operating Area (SOA)** and identifying the model's "breaking point."

## 📊 Assessment Dimensions

| Physical Factor | Key (`dims`) | Industrial Context | Implementation Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lux** | `Lux+` / `Lux-` | Environmental light fluctuation | Linear scaling & Gamma adjustment (`Lux+`: gain 1 + level/50, gamma 1/(1 + level/100); `Lux-`: gain 1/(1 + level/50), gamma 1 + level/100) |
| **Motion Blur** | `MBlur` | Conveyor/Mechanical vibration | Directional convolution kernels (line of int(level/10)·2+1 px, horizontal by default; `apply_mblur(img, level, angle=…)` for other directions) |
| **DPI/Res** | `DPI` | Working distance variations | Area-based resampling (down to (100 − level)% per side, then back to full size) |
| **Defocus** | `Defocus` | Focal drift | Gaussian-based degradation (sigma = level / 10 px) |
| **ISO Noise** | `ISO` | Low-light sensor gain | Gaussian-Normal injection |

> Formerly *PVA (Physical Validator Audit)*. The Python package is still imported as `pv_audit`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shef9432/PRVA.git
cd PRVA
pip install -e .
```

Wrap your model in an adapter (one method), then run the audit:

```python
import cv2
from pv_audit import AuditAgent, BaseAdapter


class MyModel(BaseAdapter):
    def predict(self, image):
        # Run your own model here (YOLO, ResNet, ...).
        # Return its raw output and one confidence score for this image.
        result = ...  # your inference
        return {"data": result, "conf": 0.9}


image = cv2.imread("sample.jpg")
agent = AuditAgent(MyModel())

# Stress dimensions: "Lux+", "Lux-", "MBlur", "DPI", "Defocus", "ISO" (see Assessment Dimensions)
report = agent.run(image, dims=["Lux+", "Lux-", "MBlur", "DPI", "Defocus", "ISO"], lvls=[0, 20, 40, 60])

report.to_csv("audit.csv")       # dimension, level, conf
report.plot_trend("audit.png")   # confidence vs. stress level, one line per dimension
```

Run the tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests`

## 🗺️ Roadmap: The Evolution of Industrial Reliability

### Phase 1: Physical Audit (The Present)
- **Infrastructure:** Established PhysCorruptor and Audit Logger.
- **Focus:** Quantifying the Safe Operating Area (SOA) under basic optical and environmental stressors.

### Phase 2: Parametric Engineering (In Progress)
- **Golden Reference Mapping:** Integrating high-fidelity "Golden Reference" data to map the optimal synergy between hardware and algorithmic parameters.
- **Degradation Engines:** Developing physically consistent degradation models to simulate complex material distortions and optical reflections.

### Phase 3: Cognitive Defense & Safety (Future)
- **Adversarial Closed-loop:** Implementation of "Anti-Fact" data injection to detect model hallucinations.
- **Re-calibration Engine:** Enabling automatic model rollbacks or re-calibration when the system enters a "Logic Wasteland" (i.e., non-physical confident predictions).
- **Cross-Domain Expansion:**
  - Control-PV: Assessing stability against network jitter and mechanical backlash.
  - Language-PV / Medical-PV: Extending robustness auditing to acoustic and bio-signal domains.
